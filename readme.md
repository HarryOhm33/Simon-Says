# Simon Says Game

Welcome to the **Simon Says game**! This project is a simple implementation of the classic memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Introduction

**Simon Says** is a classic game where players must remember and repeat a sequence of colors. The game starts with a random sequence generated by the computer, and the player must replicate that sequence correctly to advance to the next level. Each level increases the length of the sequence, making the game progressively challenging.
